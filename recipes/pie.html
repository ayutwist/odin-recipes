    <h3>This pumpkin cheesecake is a great alternative to traditional cheesecake — especially for pumpkin pie fans! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Cheesecake Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pumpkin Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cloves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. Spread 1 cup batter in the graham cracker crust.</li>
        <li>Make pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; stir gently until well blended. Carefully spread on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that jiggled when the pan is gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.</li>
    </ol>
